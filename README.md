# kernel-simulator
#Project Objective:
The main objective of this project is to simulate process management module of OS kernel. We
will achieve this using our existing knowledge that we have learned in class as well as in labs.
For this purpose Linux system calls such as fork ( ) , pipe( ), wait( ), signal( ) and alarm( ) can be
used.

#Project Statement:
You have to simulate following functions of Process management module: 
• Process Creation 
• Provide Environment to simulate execution of created processes. 
• Simulate exec ( ) system call. i.e. replace the current process instructions and related data
with new process and file from disk. 
• Process State transition 
• Process Scheduling (Round Robin Only). 
• Context Switching. 
• Mechanism for Inter-Process communication and process synchronization.
