# kernel-simulator
# Project Objective
The main objective of this project is to simulate process management module of OS kernel. 
For this purpose Linux system calls such as fork ( ) , pipe( ), wait( ), signal( ) and alarm( ) are used.

# Project Statement:
We have to simulate following functions of Process management module: 
• Process Creation 
• Provide Environment to simulate execution of created processes. 
• Simulate exec ( ) system call. i.e. replace the current process instructions and related data
with new process and file from disk. 
• Process State transition 
• Process Scheduling (Round Robin Only). 
• Context Switching. 
• Mechanism for Inter-Process communication and process synchronization.
